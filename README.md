Car Price Prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict used car prices based on various features such as year, present price, driven kilometers, fuel type, selling type, transmission, and owner type.

Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset, check its structure, identify missing values, and explore the distribution of car prices and relationships between features.
Data Preprocessing: Handle categorical features by encoding them into numerical representations.
Model Training: Train two regression models: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of both models using metrics such as RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Prediction: Use the trained Random Forest model (which generally performs better) to predict the selling price of a new car based on provided features.
Model Saving: Save the trained Random Forest model for future use.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is car data.csv. It contains information about various used cars.

Libraries Used
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
numpy for numerical operations.
seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization.
sklearn for machine learning tasks, including model selection, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
joblib for saving and loading the trained model.
How to Run the Code
Mount Google Drive: The notebook assumes the dataset is located in your Google Drive. Mount your Google Drive to access the dataset.
Run the Notebook: Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially.
Model Performance
The Random Forest Regressor model shows better performance compared to the Linear Regression model based on the evaluation metrics. The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices for the Random Forest model indicates a good correlation between the actual and predicted values.

Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest Regressor model to potentially improve performance.
Exploring other regression algorithms.
Feature engineering to create new features that might enhance model accuracy.
Performing more in-depth exploratory data analysis and visualization.
